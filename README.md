# RRT-and-PRM

This project plans the path of an n-link serial manipulator to move from an initial to a goal configuration while avoiding obstacles using both a probabilistic road map (PRM) path planning algorithm and a rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) path planning algorithm. The input is the initial configuration of the robot and the obstacles and the output is a video of the 2D N-link serial manipulator moving through the path. This project was done purely in Matlab using no external libraries.
